Data Analyst,CA$55k-CA$77k (Glassdoor Est.),"What's Bench? Check us out in Fintech Impact, Perkins + Will, Daily Hive, BC Business, our Instagram, and our Blog.

We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

We're a committed and talented group of diverse people working hard to solve a real, universal problem for millions of entrepreneurs: businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses. Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. We've paired smart humans with incredibly powerful software to develop the fastest, most efficient bookkeeping service in history. This lets us provide monthly and yearly financials at an incredibly accessible price, giving business owners the time, confidence, and knowledge they need to be successful.

Bench is growing fast. Recently, we've onboarded our 9000th client and our 500th employee. We have a clear, funded path to profitability, and a roadmap that we believe will rapidly accelerate the trajectory of our business. We're looking for the brightest minds who love solving tough problems to join us on this incredible journey, in pursuit of bringing financial mastery to our clients.

What's the Data team like?

At Bench, the Data team encompasses the full gamut of business intelligence and data analytics activities. We are responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure that gets analysts and leadership across the company the information they need. We do this by developing and maintaining data pipelines, a data warehouse, and visualization tools, and by leading the adoption of new technology and practices to improve the lives of our data consumers. We also ensure that our data infrastructure is fit-for-purpose by using it ourselves as analysts for our Product team, and by filling any gaps in reporting and analysis that aren't covered by analysts elsewhere in the company.

What you'll be getting up to:
Listen to requests from analysts or business partners, deeply understand their needs, and translate those needs into requirements for data products
Write analytic queries that transform raw data from source systems into business facts and metrics
Review queries, scripts, and visualizations produced by other analysts to ensure consistent accuracy and quality
Produce presentations, dashboards, and self-service tools to make data accessible to and understandable by everyone at Bench
Participate in planning and prioritization of work to be done by the Data team
Protect our clients and colleagues by maintaining security and access control over our data
Learn about emerging or established data technologies and evaluate whether Bench can benefit from their adoption
To be successful in this role, you'll need to have:
SQL proficiency: Writing, debugging, and reviewing queries that make heavy use of analytics functionality (complex aggregations, window functions, common table expressions) and that operate on many rows of data is a daily occurrence in this role.
Data visualization and storytelling: We create value when the things we build are being used. For us, that often means that data is translated into useful insights using a BI tool (eg. Tableau, Power BI), or even an effective graph or dashboard in Excel/Google Sheets.
Technical written and verbal communication: At Bench, data analysts need to interface at all levels of the organization: From going deep on technical details with fellow analysts, to explaining results to business partners, to forming recommendations for senior leadership. You possess effective written and verbal communication skills at a wide range of complexity and detail.
Responsibility: Our success depends on building trust - both among teammates and with stakeholders. To maintain that trust, we expect each other to make commitments, to keep those commitments, and to hold ourselves to account for those commitments.
Curiosity and a drive to learn: We become better analysts and technologists by learning: From our stakeholders, we learn about what's important to them and to the business (what should we do and why should we do it?); from our analytical colleagues and the wider industry, we learn about practices and tools that help us improve (how should we do it?).
Preferred:
Familiarity with version control systems: We source-control our analytics code to ensure that metrics are consistent, no matter who pulls the data. Comfort with the feature branch Git workflow model will help you understand how logic gets ""promoted to production"".
Architectural and systems thinking: Modularity and abstraction are important to us so that we can build analyses and tools that are consistent and repeatable. You can break down a complicated problem into pieces, identify when the same piece is needed in many different places, and find a general solution that makes our future lives easier.
Nose for Value: Not all requests are created equal. You know how to use your time effectively to commit just the right amount of effort to those requests, and you keep it within the bounds of your working day. Overtime is cheating!
It could be an even better fit if you have:
Exposure to AWS services useful for data analytics (eg. Redshift, Glue, Data Pipeline, DMS, Lambda)
Exposure to workflow orchestration tools (eg. Airflow, Prefect, Luigi)
Familiarity with Agile/Scrum methodologies
Previous experience in SaaS growth, product, or marketing analytics

We allow workers to be productive from anywhere on any device and have moved all the power of an on-premise phone system or contact center to the cloud to be accessed and used by modern workers in today's Work from Anywhere environment.

Who We Are

At Dialpad, work isn't a place you go, it's a thing you do. With offices in San Francisco, San Ramon, Austin, Raleigh, Vancouver, Waterloo, Tokyo, London, Sydney and Bangalore, we truly believe in finding the best talent everywhere. We also embrace the Work from Home movement and are just as happy hiring great talent from anywhere if they choose to work from home rather than in an office.

About The Role

This role is on the Natural Language Processing team in the Voice Intelligence organization of Dialpad. As an Applied Scientist, you will study real human-human conversations, looking for ways that we could provide feedback to users so that they can have more effective, empathetic, and engaging interactions with their customers. We take an eclectic approach, mixing insights and methods from Linguistics (Conversation Analysis, Sociolinguistics, syntax, semantics, Speech Act Theory) with empirical methods and state-of-the-art machine learning and computational linguistics. We have a diverse team of Applied Scientists and Data Analysts with backgrounds in Linguistics, Quantum Physics, Machine Learning, Material Science, and Computer Science.

Our recent projects have focused on how to massage the transcripts of phone conversations to make them easier to read, how to extract action items and interesting customer questions, and how to model customer sentiment.

A typical project starts with a linguistic idea as you're poring over transcripts with colleagues. You notice a recurring pattern then validate that pattern with more data. In discussions with user design and product specialists, you discuss how this linguistic insight might contribute to a product feature, e.g. to point to interesting parts of the conversation. You then draft a proposal for a new feature and then supervise a data annotation project to get the data you'll be needing to train a machine-learned model. Eventually, that R&D results in some working code that you deploy in collaboration with the engineering teams.

You must have
A Masters or Ph.D. in Linguistics, Computational Linguistics or a related technical field
Knowledge of machine learning, especially deep learning
Proficiency in Python
History of collaborating with colleagues to solve hard problems
Curiosity and desire to keep learning
Good linguistic judgments and insights
Fluency in English
Bonus points if you have
Worked with conversational data or done a major descriptive linguistics project
A publication record in the area of computational linguistics
Data analysis and reporting skills

Data Scientist (junior or intermediate),-1,"TL;DR
We’re looking for an inquisitive problem-solver who lives for continuous learning at a very fast pace and is great at sharing that knowledge with their team. We work best with humble-smart people who are quick to acknowledge what they don’t know, but driven by their curiosity to fill those gaps.
Who we are:
Modern vehicles have thousands of sensors that generate time-series data every second of every day. Preteckt has spent the last five years completely focused on turning that data into actionable predictive insights for fleets, and the results have been validated as world-leading by heavyweights in the industry. Our culture is at the core of our success. Our values are Teaching and Learning, Honesty and Transparency, and Balance. We offer a solid yet humble team, a very challenging problem with huge impact, and the resources needed to grow you into a person who regularly accomplishes what others say can’t be done.
More details on our culture can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNJFrDX_dTlbm6C-E_-nAo9m2yEqF1PL5V7aEwEFwqM
Job Description:
As a data scientist at Preteckt, you will be developing the core algorithms that enable our Subject Matter Experts (vehicle technicians) to predict and diagnose system failures on vehicles with “best in the world” precision. You’ll have access to a huge set (over 250 million miles) of densely-sampled, on-the-road data from cars, trucks, and buses including vehicle sensors, accelerometer, GPS, and repair data. You’ll be responsible for developing predictive models, deploying models to production environments, researching and evaluating the current literature on ML and AI, and much much more. We’re a startup, and that means you’ll have a wide range of responsibilities, significant autonomy on directing projects, and the opportunity to make a big impact.
Who You Are:
First and foremost, you need to love learning and teaching. We’re a small team and the data set opens the door to a lot of possible projects, so learning the tools and skills for each project is key. As well, you’ll be working not just with the data science team, but with some of the top vehicle technicians in the USA and Canada. Communication at both a technical and non-technical level is very important. We have no specific degree requirement. We have grown great data scientists that have lots of work experience but don’t have graduate degrees, and we have grown great data scientists out of fresh PhD graduates. The key to success has always been a solid match for our culture of personal growth.
*We intend to leverage a grant from the Ontario government for this position, so applicants must be currently be living somewhere in Ontario and be within three years of graduation from an undergraduate or Masters program from an Ontario college or university*
Skills you will develop fast:
The data set is a wide variety of irregularly sampled time series including sensors on vehicles, accelerometers, GPS, text documents, and more. This allows for exposure to a wide variety of technical skills:
Python (emphasis on pandas)
Preprocessing and feature reduction
Time series modeling techniques
Signal processing
Anomaly detection, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning
Processing “big data” (our data set doesn’t fit in memory...of anything)
